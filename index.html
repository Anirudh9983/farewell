      My Dear Mam,<br><br>
      I want you to know that your happiness and well-being mean the world to me. I've come to understand that sometimes, life takes unexpected turns, and our paths may diverge. If you believe that stepping away is what's best for you, I want you to follow your heart. Your desires and aspirations deserve to be honored, even if it means going in different directions.<br><br>
      While the thought of us parting ways brings a sense of sadness, it is eclipsed by a deeper understanding and a genuine desire for your happiness. If this is the path you've chosen, I want you to go with the confidence that you have my heartfelt support. Our time together has been filled with beautiful moments, and I will honestly miss the warmth of 13th April, the shared laughter of 19th December, the tenderness of 4th February, and the last day we met on 26th April. I wish that 26th April would never have ended.<br><br>
      I am grateful for the memories, lessons, and growth we havve experienced togethet. Life is a journey, and our paths may cross again in the future. Until then, I wish you nothing but the very best. May your days be filled with joy, fulfillment, and you may achieve your dreams.<br><br>
      With sincere understanding and a heart full of gratitude,<br>
      Basanti
